# quadarupted-siperbot-stm32f4

This project is a Spiderbot built on a custom PCB with an STM32F4 microcontroller. The Spiderbot uses MG996R servo motors for movement and is designed to be controlled via SPI ( PS2 ). The system includes both hardware and software components,with the hardware designs available as mechanical drawing files and circuit schematic files and controlling the movement of the robot via servo motors driven by a PCA9685 module.
